This privacy policy explains how **TonSiteWeb.ch** processes personal data for its clients and prospects.

## 1. Data controller

TonSiteWeb Sàrl acts as data controller. You can reach us at **support@tonsiteweb.ch**.

## 2. Data we collect

We only collect the information needed to prepare, deliver, and maintain your project:

- Identity and contact details (name, company, e-mail, phone number, billing address)
- Project information (sector, goals, content provided)
- Billing data and customer history
- Technical logs required for maintenance (IP address, server events, timestamps)

## 3. Purpose of processing

We use your data to:

1. respond to enquiries and prepare tailored proposals;
2. deliver websites, provide support, and maintain our services;
3. issue invoices and manage the commercial relationship;
4. analyse service usage to improve our offer (aggregate statistics only).

We do not send marketing newsletters without your explicit consent.

## 4. Legal bases

Processing is based on your consent (contact requests), the performance of a contract (project delivery, maintenance), or our legitimate interest in securing our infrastructure.

## 5. Hosting and retention

Data is hosted on servers located in Switzerland or the European Union by providers that comply with Swiss data protection law and the GDPR. We retain information for the duration of the business relationship, then for five years to meet accounting and legal obligations.

## 6. Sharing with third parties

We rely on vetted subcontractors (hosting providers, support tools, payment platforms). They access data strictly as needed for their tasks and are bound by confidentiality commitments. No transfer is made to countries lacking adequate protection without appropriate safeguards.

## 7. Your rights

You may at any time:

- request access, rectification, or deletion of your personal data;
- object to processing or request its restriction;
- receive a copy of the data you provided in a structured format (portability);
- withdraw consent whenever it is the legal basis for processing.

Contact **support@tonsiteweb.ch** to exercise your rights. We answer within 30 days.

## 8. Security measures

We implement suitable technical and organisational measures (TLS encryption, access control, regular backups). No system is entirely risk-free; please keep your credentials secure and report any suspicious activity promptly.

## 9. Cookies and analytics

Our site only uses essential cookies and privacy-friendly analytics tools (such as Plausible Analytics). You may block cookies in your browser, although certain features might be limited.

## 10. Policy updates

We may update this policy to reflect legal changes or improvements to our services. The revision date appears at the top of this page. Material changes will be communicated by e-mail or via your client portal.
