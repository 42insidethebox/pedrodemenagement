These Terms of Service (the “Terms”) govern the digital services provided by **TonSiteWeb.ch**, a brand operated by TonSiteWeb Sàrl.

## 1. Scope

TonSiteWeb.ch designs, deploys, and maintains brochure websites. By confirming an order through our website, by e-mail, or by electronically signing a quote, you agree to these Terms.

## 2. Order process

1. You complete our briefing form or join a discovery call.
2. We align on the scope (structure, content delivered, automation options) and share a written summary.
3. You receive an order confirmation detailing deliverables, pricing, and indicative timelines.
4. Production starts once the initial payment, required assets, and technical access have been provided.

Any substantial change to the approved scope will trigger a priced addendum and a revised delivery estimate.

## 3. Pricing and payment

- **Essential package**: CHF 999, based on our proprietary template tailored to your brand assets.
- **Care & security plan**: CHF 79 per month, covering software updates, monitoring, backups, and mailbox management.
- **Automation add-ons**: from CHF 1,200 (CHF 1,500 for three or more flows) for Zapier/Make integrations. A dedicated quote is issued beforehand.

Unless stated otherwise, prices are exclusive of VAT. A 50% deposit is due upon order confirmation; the balance is payable at delivery. Subscriptions are invoiced monthly or annually in advance.

## 4. Timelines

Delivery timelines are indicative and start only after we have received the deposit, required content, and access credentials. Delays caused by the client suspend the announced dates. Urgent deliveries must be confirmed in writing.

## 5. Content responsibility

You warrant that you hold the rights to all texts, visuals, and data you provide. TonSiteWeb.ch declines any liability for claims related to unlawful or infringing content. We may refuse a project that contradicts our ethics or Swiss law.

## 6. Maintenance and support

The maintenance plan includes technical monitoring, security patches, backup management, and up to two minor content updates per month. Structural changes or new features are quoted separately. Without an active subscription, post-delivery interventions are billed at CHF 140 per hour.

## 7. Hosting and domains

Unless agreed otherwise, hosting is provided through vetted cloud providers. You remain the owner of your domain name; TonSiteWeb.ch may manage it on your behalf with written permission.

## 8. Intellectual property

The final design, custom code, and produced content remain our property until full payment is received. After settlement, you obtain a non-exclusive right to use the delivered website. Open-source components remain governed by their respective licences.

## 9. Termination

Each party may terminate the agreement for cause if the other party fails to remedy a material breach after written notice. Work completed up to the termination date remains payable. Subscriptions can be cancelled at any time with 30 days' notice before the next renewal.

## 10. Data protection

Our [Privacy Policy](/en/privacy) explains how we handle personal data as controller. By accepting these Terms, you acknowledge that you have read and understood it.

## 11. Liability

Our liability is limited to direct damages proven to result from wilful misconduct or gross negligence. In any case it shall not exceed the total amount paid for the relevant service. We are not liable for lost revenue, reputational damage, or data loss caused by third-party failures, cyberattacks, or force majeure events.

## 12. Governing law and venue

These Terms are governed by Swiss law. Any dispute shall be submitted to the competent courts of the canton of Vaud, subject to prior good-faith mediation.
